#prompt structure
# define what role LLM is working as
# define LLM's responsibilities
# define boundaries
# define instructions
# define tone
# use ** --- ** to emphasize on a particular text
# ask to do not invent or hallusinate
# give a fallback text if answer is not found

# basically go step by step while writing prompt
# user query --> system --> system should know what it is doing and what are the user expectations --> if 70-90% sure just return the answer right away (use minimal language stuffing rather pure information)
# (50-70% --> merge few resources and return the answer)
# 30-50% --> merge the resorces but with proper caution
# 0-30 --> try to get to an answer but at the end add a notice like according to my context i was able to find this much but please do take caution using this answer or check with other resources or human resource too
# to change the information section use ## context/ examples....
